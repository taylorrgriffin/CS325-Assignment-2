Sequence alignment via dynamic programming
By: Taylor Griffin and Drew Ortega

This program takes in two input files, a cost matrix, and a file containing genome sequences to be aligned. The program will utilize dynamic programming to determine the optimal way to align the sequences to minimize cost.

--- USAGE ---
$ python3 align_sequences.py imp2cost.txt inp2input.txt

---
outputs result to ./imp2output.txt
